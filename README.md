## ansible-role-eclipse

This Ansible Eclipse role is based on the work from [Alban Andrieu](fr.linkedin.com/in/nabla/) which one may find [here](https://github.com/AlbanAndrieu/ansible-eclipse). It has been extensively rewritten to support any non-preconfigured plugins, different eclipse distributions (downloads) and more.

### Dependencies

This role depends on the installation of a jdk.
Documentation on that will follow.
